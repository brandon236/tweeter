# Tweeter Project

Tweeter project. 

The following is a Twitter like clone where users can post tweets with a randomized username, avatar, and handle. At the top is a nav bar which contains the new tweet button that allows users to post a new tweet. The list of tweets will have the newest tweet at the top and the oldest at the bottom. Each tweet contains the username, avatar, and handle. Below is the body which contains the tweet itself and then a footer that contains the date posted as well as three icons to the right. 

This was designed using response programming so that the tweet container and the main header will scale with the window. If the width of the window gets small enough, the elements will be aligned to one column which will stretch the width of the window.
