# Tweeter Project

Tweeter project. 

I made a nav bar which contains the new tweet button. This button creates the new tweet input box where users can post a new tweet. Each new tweet will appear at the top of the list with the newest tweets at the top and the oldest at the bottom. Each tweet contains the username, avatar, and handle at the top. It then contains the tweet itself and then a footer that contains the date posted as well as three icons to the right. 

I also designed this with response programming so that the tweet container and the main header will scale with the window. If the width of the window gets small enough, the elements will be aligned to one column which will stretch the width of the window.
